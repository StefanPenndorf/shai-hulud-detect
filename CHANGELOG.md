## [Unreleased]

## [2.1.0] - 2025-09-19

### Added
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Added robust error handling for grep pipelines to prevent script hangs (merged PR #13)
- **pnpm Support**: Added comprehensive pnpm-lock.yaml support with YAML-to-JSON transformation capability
- Shell reliability improvements with `|| true` operators and `2>/dev/null` redirections
- Error prevention for strict `set -eo pipefail` environments

### Changed
- Improved script reliability across different shell configurations and package manager environments
- Enhanced lockfile detection to support npm (package-lock.json), yarn (yarn.lock), and pnpm (pnpm-lock.yaml) formats
- Better error handling prevents silent failures that could cause script hangs

### Fixed
- Script hanging issues when grep commands fail in strict shell environments
- Silent pipeline failures that could prevent complete package detection
- Compatibility issues with different bash configurations and `pipefail` settings

### Technical Details
- Added `transform_pnpm_yaml()` function to convert YAML lockfiles to pseudo-JSON for unified processing
- Implemented temporary file management for pnpm lockfile transformation
- Enhanced find command to detect all three major lockfile formats simultaneously

## [2.0.0] - 2025-09-18

### Added
- **Multi-Attack Coverage**: Now covers ALL September 2025 npm supply chain attacks
- Added 26 packages from Chalk/Debug crypto theft attack (September 8, 2025)
- New cryptocurrency theft detection function with multiple pattern checks:
